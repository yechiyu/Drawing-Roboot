# Drawing-Roboot

This project has realized a drawing machine hand that can draw a graph according to the picture. Our idea is to generate images after drawing on a computer drawing board or on a mobile device and perform some processing on Raspberry Pi, using image processing, trajectory calculation, and trajectory optimization for path planning, then pass pictures to Raspberry Pi through a WIFI module. The Drawing Robot Draws an image on a whiteboard of an image of a picture from a computer. The Robot utilizes code and motor control system theory to convert a physical image to a position digital format and onto a whiteboard. In this vision, we will use servo motors, DC motors with encoders, and some hardware.
